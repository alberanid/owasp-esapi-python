class Encoder():
    """
    The Encoder interface contains a number of methods for decoding input and encoding output
    so that it will be safe for a variety of interpreters. To prevent
    double-encoding, callers should make sure input does not already contain encoded characters
    by calling canonicalize. Validator implementations should call canonicalize on user input
    <b>before</b> validating to prevent encoded attacks.
    <P>
    <img src="doc-files/Encoder.jpg">
    <P>
    All of the methods must use a "whitelist" or "positive" security model.
    For the encoding methods, this means that all characters should be encoded, except for a specific list of
    "immune" characters that are known to be safe.
    <p>
    The Encoder performs two key functions, encoding and decoding. These functions rely
    on a set of codecs that can be found in the org.owasp.esapi.codecs package. These include:
    <ul><li>CSS Escaping</li>
    <li>HTMLEntity Encoding</li>
    <li>JavaScript Escaping</li>
    <li>MySQL Escaping</li>
    <li>Oracle Escaping</li>
    <li>Percent Encoding (aka URL Encoding)</li>
    <li>Unix Escaping</li>
    <li>VBScript Escaping</li>
    <li>Windows Encoding</li></ul>

    def canonicalize(self, input, strict=True):
    """
    Canonicalization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded
    string down to its simplest form. This is important, because attackers
    frequently use encoding to change their input in a way that will bypass
    validation filters, but still be interpreted properly by the target of
    the attack. Note that data encoded more than once is not something that a
    normal user would generate and should be regarded as an attack.
    <p>
    Everyone <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html">says</a> you shouldn't do validation
    without canonicalizing the data first. This is easier said than done. The canonicalize method can
    be used to simplify just about any input down to its most basic form. Note that canonicalize doesn't
    handle Unicode issues, it focuses on higher level encoding and escaping schemes. In addition to simple
    decoding, canonicalize also handles:
    <ul><li>Perverse but legal variants of escaping schemes</li>
    <li>Multiple escaping (%2526 or &#x26;lt;)</li>
    <li>Mixed escaping (%26lt;)</li>
    <li>Nested escaping (%%316 or &%6ct;)</li>
    <li>All combinations of multiple, mixed, and nested encoding/escaping (%2&#x35;3c or &#x2526gt;)</li></ul>
    <p>
    Using canonicalize is simple. The default is just...
    <pre>
        String clean = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize( request.getParameter("input"));
    </pre>
    You need to decode untrusted data so that it's safe for ANY downstream interpreter or decoder. For
    example, if your data goes into a Windows command shell, then into a database, and then to a browser,
    you're going to need to decode for all of those systems. You can build a custom encoder to canonicalize
    for your application like this...
    <pre>
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.add( new WindowsCodec() );
        list.add( new MySQLCodec() );
        list.add( new PercentCodec() );
        Encoder encoder = new DefaultEncoder( list );
        String clean = encoder.canonicalize( request.getParameter( "input" ));
    </pre>
    In ESAPI, the Validator uses the canonicalize method before it does validation.  So all you need to
    do is to validate as normal and you'll be protected against a host of encoded attacks.
    <pre>
        String input = request.getParameter( "name" );
        String name = ESAPI.validator().isValidInput( "test", input, "FirstName", 20, false);
    </pre>
    However, the default canonicalize() method only decodes HTMLEntity, percent (URL) encoding, and JavaScript
    encoding. If you'd like to use a custom canonicalizer with your validator, that's pretty easy too.
    <pre>
        ... setup custom encoder as above
        Validator validator = new DefaultValidator( encoder );
        String input = request.getParameter( "name" );
        String name = validator.isValidInput( "test", input, "name", 20, false);
    </pre>
    Although ESAPI is able to canonicalize multiple, mixed, or nested encoding, it's safer to not accept
    this stuff in the first place. In ESAPI, the default is "strict" mode that throws an IntrusionException
    if it receives anything not single-encoded with a single scheme.  Currently this is not configurable
    in ESAPI.properties, but it probably should be.  Even if you disable "strict" mode, you'll still get
    warning messages in the log about each multiple encoding and mixed encoding received.
    <pre>
        // disabling strict mode to allow mixed encoding
        String url = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize( request.getParameter("url"), false);
    </pre>
